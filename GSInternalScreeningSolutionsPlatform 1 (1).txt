-----------------
	Explain your project architecture.
	What is a microservice, and what are its key characteristics?
	Is REST communication stateful or stateless?
	If stateful communication is required, how should it be implemented?
	Which API Gateway have you used, and where was it deployed/hosted?
	What are the primary responsibilities of an API Gateway?
	How do you authenticate a user in your system?
	How do you handle authorization?
	When should you use synchronous communication, and when is asynchronous communication more appropriate?
	Difference between API Gateway and service mesh
	Explain Circuit Breaker. 
		How did you implement this in your previous project?
		What is Half-opened / Half-closed state?
		Where are Circuit Breaker configurations defined? Are they placed in the main Spring properties file or in a separate configuration file for resilience settings?
	How do you handle environment-specific configuration differences across dev, QA, and production?
		How to run a Spring Boot application with externalized configuration?
	Are Java String objects mutable? 
		What is the reason behind making String immutable in Java?
		If we have String a = "Sandeep" and later update it to a = "Shukla", what exactly happens behind the scenes?
		Even though the variable a changes from "Sandeep" to "Shukla", why is the String class still called immutable?
		If a Person object is mutable, does that mean the String field storing the person's name is also mutable? What are your thoughts?
	In which scenarios should we prefer creating immutable objects, and what kinds of objects are good candidates for immutability?
